# Using Karabiner with Engram

To use Engram on MacOS, simply

1. Install Karabiner `brew install karabiner-elements` (you'll have to grant necessary permissions in `System Settings`, detailed on the [Karabiner website](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org)).
2. Click this link to open [directly in Karabiner](karabiner://karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/import?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binarybottle/engram/master/install/mac/karabiner/engram.json)

Or you can view the JSON [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binarybottle/engram/master/install/mac/karabiner/engram.json) (you'll need to place the json file in `~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/` and maybe restart Karabiner if you want to customize/ install manually).
