"I made one for Windows using the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. All the 
relevant stuff is in this zip file, including the source, which is the .klc. 
Should be able to open it and edit it if need be for any reason. To install 
the layout, either click setup.exe or the .msi file specific to your 
computer's processor. Setup.exe just seems to figure it out for you. You can 
use the same msi to uninstall or repair."

"I claim no ownership rights. Use however you like. Thank you for your 
awesome work on this layout."
