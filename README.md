# Engram

This project is a rewrite of the [Engram algorithm proposed by Arno Klein](https://github.com/binarybottle/engram)[^arno]. The objectives of these rewrite are to have the code:
- Run faster (about 50Ã— faster, while the original program takes hours to run),
- Can more easily use different scoring systems,
- Can more easily be used to develop layouts for other languages.

[^arno]: The project has been from [Arno Klein's Engram](https://github.com/binarybottle/engram) as an acknowledgement of the algorithm being his idea. Everything in the project has then be scraped in favor of a complete rewriting.
